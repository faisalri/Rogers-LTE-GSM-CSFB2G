# Rogers LTE-GSM CSFB2G Script Generator

Welcome to the **Rogers LTE-GSM CSFB2G Script Generator** web application!
This Streamlit app provides a simple and efficient way to generate configuration scripts for Circuit Switched Fallback (CSFB) from LTE to GSM 2G, based on a customizable template.

## Features

### Script Generation
* **Nodename Input**: Easily enter the specific *nodename* (e.g., `MNCO09XMA`) which will be used in the generated script and as part of the output filename.
* **Cellnames Input**: Provide a list of *cellnames* (e.g., `MNCOXA|MNCOXB|MNCOXC`) separated by `|`. The app will dynamically generate `GeranFreqGroupRelation` entries based on these inputs and determine whether to use `cr` or `crn` based on the internal logic derived from your template example.
* **Dynamic Output Filename**: The generated script will have a filename format like `NODENAME_csfb2G_YYMMDD-HHMM.mos`.
* **Download Option**: After generation, you can preview the script and download it directly as a `.mos` file.

### Template-Based Generation
The core of the script generation relies on an external `template-csfb2G.txt` file, making it flexible and easy to update the underlying configuration logic without changing the app's code.
